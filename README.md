Hello! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [University of Connecticut](http://www.uconn.edu), working under the supervision of [Keith Conrad](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu). My research is broadly in the areas of algebraic number theory and $p$-adic analysis. In particular, I am currently working on some problems related to the logarithm of Lubin-Tate formal group laws.
