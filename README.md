Hello! I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at the [University of Connecticut (UConn)](http://www.uconn.edu), working under the supervision of [Keith Conrad](https://kconrad.math.uconn.edu). My research is broadly in the areas of algebraic number theory and p-adic analysis. In particular, I am currently working on some problems related to the logarithm of Lubin-Tate formal group laws.

I completed my first Master's degree at [Imperial College London](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/) in 2021 and my second Master's degree at the [University of Cambridge](https://www.cam.ac.uk/) in 2022. I recieved my Bachelor's degree from [Royal Holloway, University of London](https://www.royalholloway.ac.uk/) in 2020. My CV is [here](cv.pdf).
